# Covid-19 Dashboard
South Africa had its first corona virus case confirmed on the 5th of March and since then we have evaluated different ways to make people aware of the virus and the length in which it spreads. We then came up with the idea of creating a dashboard which consists of data ranging from the spread of the virus since the beginning to date. We also included a worldwide figure of Covid-19 and the stats of the virus in different provinces within South African borders, as well as the different public and private hospitals to visit. We then also focused on our citizens by including different insights we received from them on the virus.

### For more information here's a link to our dashboard:
